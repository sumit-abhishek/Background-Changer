# Background Color Changer

The Background Color Changer project is a simple web application built using React to demonstrate the effective use of the useState hook. This application allows users to change the background color of the webpage by entering a color name and clicking a "Change Color" button. The useState hook manages the state of the input field and the selected color, updating the background dynamically based on user input. By working on this project, the fundamental concept of state management in React using the useState hook is solidified, providing a practical example of creating a responsive and interactive user experience. This project serves as a great introduction to React hooks and showcases how to handle user input, state updates, and event handling efficiently.
